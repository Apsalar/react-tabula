# react-tabula

React table component

## Local Setup
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run tests: `npm test`
- Build: `npm run build`

## History
- react-tabula was originally forked from carlosrocha/react-data-components
  but since it will be significantly modified and re-designed, I've decided
  to separate the project name.
- The `migrate/` directory is where the original package.json and webpack.json
  adapted from the rackt/react-router project. Ideally, react-tabula will be
  moved to working test coverage based on karma and mocha/jasmine (and away
  from jest,
